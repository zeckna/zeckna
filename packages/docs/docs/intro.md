Zeckna is a privacy-first wallet, SDK, and AI automation layer that blends Zcash shielded transactions with Solana-grade performance. The project ships as a pnpm monorepo with Rust, TypeScript, React Native, and AI services working together.

## What you get

- **Rust core** that produces WebAssembly bindings for shielded addresses, key derivation, and transaction construction.
- **TypeScript SDK** for Node, web, and React Native environments.
- **Mobile wallet** built with React Native to deliver a non-custodial user experience.
- **AI orchestrators** that translate natural language requests into shielded transactions and privacy policies.
- **Docs, website, and tooling** to move from prototype to production.

Follow the guides in this documentation set to install the toolchain, integrate the SDK, and deploy AI-driven shielded workflows. For a high-level product narrative, continue to [Zeckna Vision](./vision.md).

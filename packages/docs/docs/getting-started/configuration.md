Secure configuration keeps shielded keys private while enabling AI services to reason over wallet data.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the repository root (never commit it) with the following shape:

```bash
# Rust core / SDK
ZECKNA_NETWORK=mainnet

# Wallet storage
ZECKNA_KEYSTORE_DIR=/path/to/encrypted/store

# AI providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

The mobile app reads variables via `.env.development` or `.env.production` and injects them using Metro configuration. The SDK exposes helpers to locate the keystore and pass encrypted payloads to the Rust core.

## Secrets handling

- Use OS keychains or a secret manager for production deployments.
- Never store seed phrases or view keys unencrypted on disk.
- When testing, prefer disposable mnemonics generated by `@zeckna/sdk`.

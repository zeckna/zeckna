Zeckna aims to make private finance programmable. The roadmap is guided by three principles:

1. **End-to-end privacy** – Shielded Zcash primitives, encrypted storage, and audit-ready zk attestations are first-class citizens.
2. **Multi-chain reach** – Solana, Ethereum L2s, and future chains can connect through bridges and wrapped assets without sacrificing privacy guarantees.
3. **Agentic automation** – AI assistants orchestrate policies, budgets, and executions while humans retain key custody and policy control.

### Key milestones

- **MVP**: Ship the wallet, SDK, and initial AI workflows for Zcash shielded transactions.
- **Cross-chain bridge**: Bring wrapped ZEC onto Solana with attestations verified through Zeckna’s Rust core.
- **Enterprise controls**: Add programmable compliance tooling, multi-sig, and granular viewing permissions.
- **Open ecosystem**: Publish templates, agent blueprints, and reference integrations to accelerate partners.
